                <p>Climate change refers to a long-term shift in the earth’s weather pattern. Before the mid-1800s,
                    climate change was natural. For example, changes in the earth’s orbit or volcanic eruptions were the
                    cause of climate change. But since the mid-1800s, the cause behind climate change is human
                    activities because humans have increasingly used fossil fuel for their everyday life. Fossil fuels
                    have loads of greenhouse gases inside them. When we use fossil fuel, the greenhouse gases inside
                    them gets released into the air, which results in climate change. For example, the Global mean sea
                    level has risen about 8–9 inches (21–24 centimeters) since 1880, with about a third of that coming
                    in just the last two and a half decades. The rising water level is mostly due to a combination of
                    meltwater from glaciers and ice sheets and the thermal expansion of seawater as it warms. And some
                    greenhouse gases can trap more heat than other greenhouse gases. Methane can trap 25 times more heat
                    than Carbon dioxide.</p>

                <div class="sec-3-text">
                    <p>In the past 4.5 billion years, the climate has been changing rapidly. The cause behind these
                        climate changes were natural disasters that included changes in the earth's orbit or volcanic
                        eruptions. In the past one million years our planet has faced multiple ice ages that included
                        colder periods and warmer periods. Glacial and interglacial periods occur every one hundred
                        years due to changes in the earth's orbit around the sun. However, since the Industrial
                        Revolution in the 1800s, the global temperature has increased at a much faster rate. By burning
                        fossil fuels and changing how we use the land, human activity has quickly become the leading
                        cause of changes to our climate. </p>

                        known as greenhouse effects. These greenhouse gases are getting produced by humans and natural
                        resources. Greenhouse gases are Carbon dioxide, Methane, nitrous oxide naturally form in the
                        atmosphere. When the radiation of the sun reaches the earth, some of it passes throw the
                        atmosphere and heats the surface. The surface absorbs most of the radiation and gives off
                        longer-wavelengths infrared radiation. The greenhouse gases absorb the radiation and reflect
                        some of it in all directions, reflecting some of it to the surface, this is the reason behind
                        global warming.

Nowadays, Carbon dioxide is the most released greenhouse gas. It causes 80% of global warming. There are some examples of human activates which cause climate change and global warming:

                        When Carbon dioxide inside the fossil fuels is released into the air, there are many risks of diseases that include stroke, heart disease, lung cancer, and respiratory illness among those exposed.

                        When we cut forest, there are many problems attached to it that include: 
There will be no trees to take Carbon dioxide from the air, resulting in Carbon dioxide levels, increase. And when we burn trees, the stored Carbon dioxide inside the trees gets released and causes air pollution.

                        Planting crops and rearing animals releases many different types of greenhouse gases into the air. For example, animals produce methane, which is 30 times more powerful than carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas. The nitrous oxide used for fertilizers is ten times worse and is nearly 300 times more potent than carbon dioxide!
